# Project Overview 

The Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) website provides public access to public school and district data. Although the data is legitimately public, access is not enough for the public to understand and interpret the data.  This project aimed to resolve these issues and focus on the popular topics of school test scores, COVID impact, school testing trends, and school spending.  

Schools are mandated to report their spending based on the average teacher salary within a district.  It would be more accurate to view a school budget based on average teacher salary per school.  For each Kentucky school with available data, this project estimated the school budget, and compared the estimated school spending with the previous school test scores.


## Original Data

The original data was retrieved from the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) website or directly from a KDE representative.
